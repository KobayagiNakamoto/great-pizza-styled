        <h2>What is the difference between good and great pizza?</h2>
        <p>
            Let's face it. You have to really try in order to mess up a pizza.
            Instead of kneading, you can buy pre-made dough. Throw your ingredients
            of choice on it, whack it in an owen and wait it out while you munch on
            leftover grated cheese. I guarantee you that anyone that takes a bite,
            can put a label "decent" on it.
        </p>
        <p><strong>But what makes it great?</strong></p>

        <h2>Meassurements</h2>
        <img src="images/bowl.jpg" width="100%"
            alt="Mixing flour in a bowl" />
        <p>
            With baker's percentages, every ingredient is represented by its
            proportion by weight to the flour in a recipe. When coupled with the
            metric system and its logical base-ten measures, it helps liberate you
            from recipes.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, for instance, if a pizza dough recipe calls for 60% water (also
            known as 60% hydration), 2% salt, and .5% yeast, that means that for
            every 1,000 grams of flour, you'd add 600 grams of water, 20 grams of
            salt, and 5 grams of yeast.
        </p>
        <p>
            The advantage of the system is that it allows you to scale a recipe up
            and down freely without having to recalculate fussy cups or tablespoons.
            Once you get yourself a scale that measures in grams, you'll be throwing
            together batches of dough, large or small, in no time.

        <p>
            Flour is the main ingredient in pizza dough, and the type you use can
            have a big effect on the end result. All-purpose flour will work fine,
            but if you want a<a

            yourself some high protein bread flour. I use either King Arthur-brand
            bread flour, or imported Antimo Caputo bread or pizza flour (which is
            ground more finely than its American flour counterparts).

        <h2>Picking a style</h2>
        <img src="images/pizza-styles.jpg" width="100%"
            alt="charred crust pizza" />
        <p>
            Are you looking for hardcore Neapolitan-style pizza with fresh
            mozzarella and a soft, crisp crust? Or are you in the mood for New
            York-style pizza, with a more substantial crunch and a layer of grated,
            dry mozzarella?
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're looking to feed a large crowd with minimal fuss and fool-proof
            end results, then you might consider attempting a Sicilian-style square
            pie, or an easy no-knead, no-stretch pan pizza.

            Our recipes are simple enough that a complete pizza noob can make them
            without fail on their very first try.

        <h2>Fermentation</h2>

        <p>
            Cold fermenting your dough—that is, storing it in the refrigerator after
            forming it, can help improve both its flavor and, its browning
            characteristics as the yeast slowly gets to work digesting
            carbohydrates.

        <h2>Heat</h2>

            Why does the local pizzeria's pizza taste better than the stuff you make
            at home?
        </p>
        <p>
            It's likely because their oven is hotter than yours. A hotter oven leads
            to superior oven-spring—the early phase of baking during which air and
            vapor bubbles inside dough rapidly expand, causing the dough to become
            airy and full of holes. A hot oven also creates a better contrast
            between crisp, lightly charred exterior, and soft, cloud-like interior.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the very least, you should be baking your pizzas as hot as your oven
            will go—generally in the 550°F range
